# reltrad
Reltrad is a classification typology for religious tradition. It was first proposed by Steensland et al (2000). 

Previous iterations of this code available online have had syntax flaws that have led to undercounting evangelicals. This has been described in a research report, "Reltrad Coding Problems and a New Repository" which was published in the journal of Politics and Religion. A link to that article is here: http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10079234

This repository contains four files: 


1. A Stata do file for creating the reltrad classification scheme for the GSS cumulative file. 
2. A Stata do file for creating the reltrad classification scheme for the National Election Study cumulative file. (This has been deprecated but I am leaving it here for reference.)
3. A Stata do file for creating the reltrad classification scheme for the National Election Study cumulative file prior to 1990 (as well as 2002)
4. A Stata do file for creating the reltrad classification scheme for the National Election Study cumulative file after 1990 (except 2002)

In addition, here is a link to the full GSS dataset from 1972-2016 with the addition of the reltrad variable.

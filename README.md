# RELTRAD syntax coding

Reltrad is a classification typology for religious tradition. It was first proposed by [Steensland et al (2000).](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article/79/1/291/2233984/The-Measure-of-American-Religion-Toward-Improving) 

Previous iterations of this code available online have had syntax flaws that have led to undercounting evangelicals. This has been described in a research report, "Reltrad Coding Problems and a New Repository" which was published in the journal of Politics and Religion. A link to that article is [here](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10079234) 

This repository contains five files: 

[1. A Stata do file for creating the reltrad classification scheme for the GSS cumulative file.](https://github.com/ryanburge/reltrad/blob/master/Stata_Coding_GSS) 

[2. A Stata do file for creating the reltrad classification scheme for the National Election Study cumulative file. (This has been deprecated but I am leaving it here for reference.)](https://github.com/ryanburge/reltrad/blob/master/Stata_Coding_NES)

[3. A Stata do file for creating the reltrad classification scheme for the National Election Study cumulative file prior to 1990 (as well as 2002)](https://github.com/ryanburge/reltrad/blob/master/NES_Prior_to_1990)

[4. A Stata do file for creating the reltrad classification scheme for the National Election Study cumulative file after 1990 (except 2002)](https://github.com/ryanburge/reltrad/blob/master/NES_1990_Present)

[5. A folder with R script files for creating reltrad classification for the Cooperative Congressional Election Study in 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016](https://github.com/ryanburge/reltrad/tree/master/CCES)

# Don't want to mess with all this scripting?

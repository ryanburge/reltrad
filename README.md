# RELTRAD syntax coding

Reltrad is a classification typology for religious tradition. It was first proposed by [Steensland et al (2000).](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article/79/1/291/2233984/The-Measure-of-American-Religion-Toward-Improving) 

Previous iterations of this code available online have had syntax flaws that have led to undercounting evangelicals. This has been described in a research report, "Reltrad Coding Problems and a New Repository" which was published in the journal of Politics and Religion. A link to that article is [here](http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=10079234) 

This repository contains three folders: 

[1. A folder for the Cooperative Congressional Election Study Code (contains R code only)](https://github.com/ryanburge/reltrad/tree/master/CCES) 

[2. A folder for the General Social Survey (contains both Stata and R code) ](https://github.com/ryanburge/reltrad/tree/master/GSS)

[3. A folder for the National Election Study cumulative contains (contains State code only)](https://github.com/ryanburge/reltrad/tree/master/NES)
